              EDGE-BASED PLATE STRAIGHTENER - START HERE
================================================================================

QUICKEST WAY TO TEST:
=====================
Double-click this file:  test_straightener.bat


WHAT THIS MODULE DOES:
======================
Takes a cropped license plate image (from YOLO detection) and straightens
it using top and bottom edge detection for horizontal alignment.

- Uses Canny edge detection
- Hough Line Transform to find horizontal edges
- Aligns plate based on detected edges
- Shows 3-panel visualization (Original | Straightened | Detected Edges)

RECOMMENDED READING ORDER:
==========================
1. START_HERE.txt          (You are here - quick overview)
2. SETUP_COMPLETE.md       (Complete guide with test results)
3. USAGE_GUIDE.md          (How to use - commands and examples)
4. README.md               (Technical details if interested)


QUICK TEST INSTRUCTIONS:
========================
Option 1 (Easiest):
  - Double-click: test_straightener.bat

Option 2 (Command Line):
  - Open Anaconda Prompt
  - cd C:\Users\maazs\Documents\Projects\ALPR_TollPlaza_System\test
  - conda activate alpr_dev
  - python demo_straightener.py "path\to\image.jpg"

Option 3 (Test with snapshot):
  - Double-click: test_with_snapshot.bat
  - Drag and drop any image onto it


WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
================
A window with 3 panels:
  [Original Plate] | [Straightened Plate] | [Detected Edges]

Console output showing:
  - Detected angle
  - Whether correction was needed
  - Method used
  - Output file location

Press any key in the window to close it.


OUTPUT FILES:
=============
Straightened images are saved as:
  original_name_straightened.jpg

Located in this test/ folder.


KEY FEATURES:
=============
✓ Works with cropped RGB plates from YOLO (not preprocessed images)
✓ Uses top/bottom edge detection for horizontal alignment
✓ Hough Line Transform for accurate angle detection
✓ 3-panel visualization with detected edges
✓ Automatic fallback to contour method if needed
✓ Smart cropping to remove excess borders
✓ NOT integrated with main ALPR (standalone module)


TESTED WITH:
============
✓ Your screenshot: C:\Users\maazs\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2026-01-06 010749.png
✓ Detected angle: -1.00°
✓ Status: Working correctly


INTEGRATION (OPTIONAL):
=======================
To use in your ALPR pipeline, add in alpr_engine.py AFTER YOLO detection:

    from test.plate_straightener import PlateStraightener
    straightener = PlateStraightener(min_angle_threshold=1.0)
    plate_img, angle, debug = straightener.process(plate_img)

See SETUP_COMPLETE.md for detailed integration instructions.


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
Issue: conda not recognized
  → Use Anaconda Prompt instead of regular Command Prompt

Issue: Window doesn't appear
  → Check behind other windows, look for console errors

Issue: No edges detected
  → Normal if plate is already straight
  → Module will use fallback contour method

Issue: Wrong angle detected
  → Check the edges panel (right side) to see what was detected


CONFIGURATION:
==============
To change sensitivity, edit demo_straightener.py line 46:

    min_angle_threshold=1.0   (default - balanced)
    min_angle_threshold=0.5   (aggressive - straighten slight tilts)
    min_angle_threshold=2.0   (conservative - only major tilts)


STATUS:
=======
✅ Module complete and working
✅ Tested with your screenshot  
✅ All files in test/ folder
✅ Documentation complete
✅ Ready to use


NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Double-click test_straightener.bat to see it in action
2. Read SETUP_COMPLETE.md for full details
3. Test with your snapshot images
4. (Optional) Integrate with ALPR pipeline
